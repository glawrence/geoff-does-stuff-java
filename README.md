# Geoff Does Stuff (Java)

This is a Java project to accompany Geoff Does Stuff. Some things are easier to show in code with comments than to document with code snippets. The aim of this project is to show how some Java things work.

It is worth adding that [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/) is being used as well as [Gradle Build Tool](https://gradle.org/).
