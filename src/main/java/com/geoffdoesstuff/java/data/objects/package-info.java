/**
 * This package contains data or plain Java objects, which are used in the demo classes.
 * <p>
 * Any classes added to this package or any child packages should also be plain Java objects. It should be noted that
 * Java Records are really just plain Java objects, so we can include them too.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Records can implement interfaces, like {@link java.lang.Comparable}. {@link java.lang.Object#toString() toString()}, equals() and hashCode() get generated too.
